Add Code Snippets:

1) Type in the code you want to create a snippet for.
2) Highlight the code.
3) Drag the highlighted code and drop it on the Snippet utility section.
4) Click the snippet, a popup caption dialog will appear. Edit the title, description, and shortcut.

NOTE: You can use prompters denoted by <#prompterName#> that will give blue bubbles that you can tab to, and replace with "parameters" in your source. For example:

NSDictionary *<#varibleName#> = [[NSBundle mainBundle] infoDictionary];

Also, to delete your snippets, click to highlight in the snippet library, and press the "Delete" key.
